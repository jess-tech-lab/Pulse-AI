While no critical issues were identified, the recurring low-impact concerns suggest a need for strategic improvements to enhance user and employee satisfaction. Beverage quality, specifically the taste of certain drinks, has been highlighted as a problem, potentially affecting customer perception. Additionally, employee discount policies, benefits, and training platforms are areas where usability friction is evident, indicating a need for policy review and better resource allocation. Equipment maintenance, particularly the timely repair of machines, is another area requiring attention to prevent operational disruptions. Addressing these issues could improve overall satisfaction and operational efficiency, aligning with Starbucks' commitment to quality and employee welfare."
